                    <h3>What is { app_name }?</h3>
                    <p>
                        With { app_name } you can shorten any long URL. You can create a link starting with { app_urldomain }. Use this
                        short link where long URLs are inconvenient, such as in presentation slides or print and on social media.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The short links have the form { app_urldomain }/<i>code</i> and do not expire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        { app_name } can be used free of charge by all students, staff, and researchers of institutions affiliated with
                        { app_idp_name }.
                    </p>

                            is safer and more privacy-friendly than commercial alternatives. Thanks to { app_idp_name } only members
                            can create links. In this way we prevent abuse.

                        <li>
                            does not store any personal data. Through { app_idp_name }, { app_name }
                            only receives a persistent pseudonym.

                    <h3>Creating and editing links</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To create a shortened link you need a { app_idp_name } account. Select your setting from the list. If your
                            setting is not there yet, see below under the heading 'Login'.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Paste the URL you want to shorten into the text field. You will get your unique { app_urldomain }-URL, which
                            you can
                            use immediately. The code is random, not case sensitive and without potentially confusing characters (such as
                            the number zero and the letter o).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When you are logged in, you will see an overview of all the links you have created. For each link you will see
                            the total number of visits since the creation date. You can edit (change the target link) or delete these links.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If a short link is removed, it will not be reissued: all links are unique. So another user will never get a
                            shortened link that you have removed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        Anyone can open a { app_urldomain } link by typing it into a browser or clicking on it. The links are not case
